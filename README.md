### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Let's talk about FaresHamouda

My academic journey began with a comprehensive bachelor's degree in Tunisia, which included a competitive end-of-studies internship facilitated by the prestigious Mitacs Globalink program. This internship at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al focused on edge computing and provided invaluable hands-on experience in the field.

Following this accomplishment, I was honored to receive a Mitacs fellowship and earn a fully funded scholarship at York University, where I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering. Alongside my studies, I serve as a Teaching Assistant and collaborate on research projects with IBM, contributing to the development of a data migration framework that was recently published in ICPE 2024.

I am on track to complete my studies by summer 2024 and am eager to leverage my skills and experiences in the field post-graduation.
