### Hi there 👋
# Let's talk about FaresHamouda
🚨 &nbsp; For the last two years most of of my work was with companies . I'm sorry , I cannot share it. 🥺

As someone who is always passionate for learning more about tech and life. Fares Hamouda grew up admiring systems architecture and highly available designs . From those humble beginnings, he has evolved into a Cloud Infrastracture/ Devops Engineer who loves working with cutting edge tools and technologies, experimenting design×development and keen to share his experience with people around the world. He, like any developer who has burnt the midnight oil, knows how to make a mean cup of coffee ☕️ ! 

  * 💬 &nbsp; People ask him about `Kubernetes , Helm , Terraform , Docker , Etcd , Linux , Node / Express, VueJs, MongoDB, Java, PYTHON, etc`.
  * 📖 &nbsp; Learning about `Aws , systems architecture`
